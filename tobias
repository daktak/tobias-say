I’m afraid that I just blue myself.

I like the way they shape my junk.

This is ripe for parody. This is ripe!
%
I’m afraid I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run if you will, so I’m afraid I have something of a mess on my hands.
%
Can I get some more of that acting juice?
%
Things are good.   Nothing much.  I’m a registered sex offender, but things are good.
%
We are fucked.  Fucked. Unless some sort of miracle coincidence happens.  But, the best thing is to just walk away, and we’ll lick each others wombs.
%
Maybe I’ll do my famous “gay character”.  I don’t think you’ve seen that one.
%
You can do anything I want you to do.
%
Ha ha ha ha ha ha… That red haired lady can’t throw her wad at that guy.
%
Well universe, you seem to be putting up all sorts of walls between me and my dreams.

%
I’m here to see my little girl.  I need to show her Daddy’s Thing.

I’ve got a stick up my bunghole about what has become a running joke about me, but lets be honest, Michael, for 2000 rupees we’d both go down on Matthew McConaughey.
%
There we go, now I can see a pretty face under all that butter substitute.
%
It’s Okay.  Some people struggle with addiction.  Other people are incapable of ever being nude.

Oh no, there’s nothing ambiguous about me.  I’m Johnny Flamer, and this is Sue Storm.
%
And this is “Kids”, from “Bye, Bye, Birdie”.
%
And this is “You’re A Bad, Bad, Man” from “Annie Get Your Gun.”
%
If this were a Lifetime Moment Of Truth movie, this would be our act break.
%
I just need to prove to my wife that I can act like a man. And it’s not about sex. I don’t just lie there, if that’s what you’re thinking.
%
Well, I’ve always wanted to remake Annie Hall. Except, I wouldn’t want to get in bed with a green producer like a Sofia Coppola though. Oh, but give me an old pro like a Robert Redford.

Perhaps an attic shall I seek…

Time for me to take off my receptionist skirt and put on my Barbara Streisand in the Prince Of Tides ass-masking therapist pantsuit.

And with deep, deep concentration and, and great focus, he’s often able to achieve an erec…

Even if it means me taking a chubby, I will suck it up!
%
Oh, my God, we’re having a fire!!! Sale.
%
Ooh, I can taste those meaty, leading man parts in my mouth!
%
So Anne, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer.
